# Hotel Reservation Website - Advanced Database Techniques Project üè®

## Project Goal and Description üìù

The "Hotel Reservation Website" project was developed as part of the "Advanced Techniques of Database" course, focusing on enhancing our understanding of database management systems, MySQL procedures, triggers, and transaction isolation levels. The primary goal of the project was to design and implement a Java EE web application that simulates a hotel reservation system, while also delving into advanced database concepts.

### Key Objectives:

1. **MySQL Procedures and Triggers**: The project aimed to apply MySQL procedures and triggers to streamline various hotel reservation processes. This included defining procedures to automate tasks like room availability checks, reservation modifications, and cancellation operations. Triggers were employed to enforce specific business rules and maintain data consistency across related tables.

2. **Transaction Isolation Levels**: Understanding the nuances of transaction isolation levels was another focal point of the project. By experimenting with different isolation levels such as READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, and SERIALIZABLE, we aimed to grasp the impact of each level on concurrency control, data integrity, and system performance.

3. **Web Application Development**: Building the hotel reservation website required creating a dynamic and user-friendly Java EE web application. Users could explore available rooms, make reservations, view booking details, and manage their bookings. The web interface provided a seamless experience for guests while ensuring that database operations were performed accurately behind the scenes.

4. **Data Consistency and Integrity**: Implementing procedures, triggers, and isolation levels emphasized the significance of maintaining data consistency and integrity, especially in a transaction-heavy environment. Through this project, we deepened our understanding of database mechanisms that safeguard data quality and prevent anomalies.

5. **Practical Application of Database Concepts**: The project offered a hands-on opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge gained in the database course. By working on a real-world scenario of hotel reservations, we bridged the gap between academic learning and practical implementation, reinforcing our grasp of advanced database techniques.

### Overall Learning Outcomes:

- Improved understanding of MySQL procedures and triggers.
- Insight into the nuances of transaction isolation levels and their impact on database operations.
- Proficiency in developing Java EE web applications with robust database integration.
- Enhanced ability to design and manage a database system that caters to complex business requirements.
- Strengthened problem-solving skills by addressing challenges related to concurrency control, data integrity, and user interaction.

By successfully completing the "Hotel Reservation Website" project, we not only advanced our database expertise but also gained valuable experience in building feature-rich web applications that seamlessly interact with a database backend. The project's emphasis on practical application enriched our skill set and prepared us to tackle real-world scenarios that demand effective database management and web development practices.

## How to Run the Project ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
